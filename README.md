# Phase 3 - Implementation

In the second part of your assignment you are tasked to implement your proposed roadmap.

The proposed workflow is:
1. Create a branch from main
2. Write some code (could be multiple commits)
3. Merge the branch back to main

If you face any issues with git and your rep[o,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OMi30WhdJR7_zEDXae4ac9X5S8KhTeWe/view?usp=share_link) ping one of us and we will be quick to assist.

In case you are not familiar with git basics feel free to ask us for help.

## Deliverables

**Code**

Make sure to follow good coding practises. Comments (when appropriate) are important. Include run instructions in a README. 
We will read and execute your code on our machines.

Also, make sure that you have a demo that showcases you work.
This demo could be:
* a command line app
* a jupyter notebook
* a simple app with GUI

We will have a technical examination too where we are going to ask each member about specific parts of their code. 

**Report**

In the report you will document all the work you did. More specifically you could include:
* Brief description of the original paper
* The methods you implemented, difficulties you faced, modification/simplifications you made
* Datasets you used and experiments along with their results
* Your conclusions

You should use a SIGMOD paper template like [this one](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sigplan-proceedings-template/rfvsrhgmghtc).
> **Tip:** Change line 37 from `\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}` to `\documentclass[sigconf, nonacm]{acmart}`to get rid of all the acm specific sections.

**Make sure your report is well-written and detailed. It is a big part of your grade**

**Presentation**

A brief presentation of your work in a similar fashion like assignment 1.
We will give more details about the presentation requirements the following days.
